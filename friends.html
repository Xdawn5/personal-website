<p>I have several friends in different grades. Most of them are sophmores like myself, and we have some of our classes together. I have known at least one of my friends since kindergarten, and we are basically brother and sister. His name is Noah Holland. </p>

<p>I have a couple friends still in middle school. One is a sixth grader, the other an eighth grader. Patience Smith is in sixth grade, and Stephanie Stricklin is in eighth grade I have few freshman friends. They are Victoria Melson, Chelsea Robbins, and Emily Davis. I get annoyed with two of them, but it's hard to stay annoyed with them. My sophmore friends are Noah Holland, Bret Dietz, Billy Gatlin, Kalie Spurlin, Chloe Bain, Anna Espey, Jacob Fisher, Anna Meadows, Danielle Murphy, Jasmine Mancell, Marie Chapel, Vivian Melson, and Linsdey Henderson. Modty of those sophmores are like my brothers and sisters. I have at least one or two junior friends. They are Reuben Wilkerson and Sarah Grace Barnes. I have one senior friend.
